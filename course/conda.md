# Conda

[Conda](https://conda.io/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/conda/conda) [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) and environment manager, effectively [combining](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-pip-virtualenv-translator.html) the functionalities of `pip` and `virtualenv`. It is included in [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/what-is-anaconda) and [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). Anaconda is a popular Python data science platform created by [Continuum Analytics, Inc.](https://www.continuum.io/) As of August 2017, Continuum claimed on its website that Anaconda had over 4.5 million users and over a thousand data science packages. Miniconda is a small version that includes only conda, Python, and the packages they depend on. [Anaconda packages](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs) can be installed individually from the [Continuum repository](https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/) with the `conda install <package-name>` command.

The conda [test drive](https://conda.io/docs/test-drive.html) takes around 30 minutes for new users to get started. It is a shortened version of the official [user guide](https://conda.io/docs/using/using.html).
