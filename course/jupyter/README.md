# Jupyter Notebook

The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an [open-source](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) web application that was born out of the [IPython](https://ipython.org/) project. It is a very useful tool for visualizing data-driven workflows in [Python](http://realai.org/course/python/), and can be easily [installed on a Google Compute virtual machine](http://realai.org/course/GCE/jupyter/). We can interactively run Python code in the Notebookâ€™s code cells, and add formatted text to [Markdown cells](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). Like [Vim](http://realai.org/course/tools/vim/), the Notebook has a modal interface. There are two modes: edit mode and command mode. Many [keyboard shortcuts](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html#Keyboard-Navigation) are available in edit mode to improve efficiency. Follow these [examples](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/examples_index.html) to learn the [basics](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html) of Jupyter Notebook.
