* Use another separator such as `#` if the strings contain the character `/`

### Changing Letter Case

* Type `gUU` to change all letters in the current line to upper case
* Type `guu` to change all letters in the current line to lower case 
* Type `g~~` to switch the case of all letters in the current line

### Multi-Line Insertion

* Use or send key shortcut `Ctrl+V` to start visual block mode
* Hit `j` multiple times to select several lines
* Hit `I` and insert some text at the beginning of the first line
* Hit `Esc` to exit visual block mode, the inserted text will appear shortly
