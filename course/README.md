# Course

## Basic IT

* Virtual Machines: [Google Compute Engine](http://realai.org/course/GCE/)
* Interactive Code Editor: [Jupyter Notebook](http://realai.org/course/jupyter/)

[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) is a popular operating system that we will use during this course.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular code repository hosting site that uses the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system. [Git How To](https://githowto.com/) offers a simple guided tour that walks through the fundamentals of Git.

* Text editor: [Vim](http://realai.org/course/tools/vim/)
* Text processing: [grep](http://realai.org/course/tools/grep/), sed, awk, and regular expression
* Programming language: [Python](http://realai.org/course/python/)

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is one of the most popular [deep learning libraries](http://realai.org/course/lib/) that we will use to implement projects. We can set it up in a [Jupyter Notebook running on GCE](http://realai.org/course/GCE/jupyter/).
