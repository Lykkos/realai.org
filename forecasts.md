# Forecasts

Below is a list of milestones that we forecast will be achieved based on our *subjective* views of progress in deep learning. These forecasts are highly likely to change as new discoveries are made and new results announced.

* 2019 March 6 (± 3 months). [Multi-Player No-Limit Poker](#multi-player-no-limit-poker)

## Multi-Player No-Limit Poker

Multi-player no-limit [Texas hold’em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em) is one of the most popular forms of poker, widely televised in events like the [World Series of Poker](http://www.wsop.com/). On March 6, 2017, University of Alberta professor [Michael Bowling](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/) [said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MichaelHBowling/status/838426697817067520) that in this game, computer programs would beat human pros in “a couple years”. Prof. Bowling is a world-leading expert in computer poker. He led a [research group](http://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/) that published [Cepheus](http://poker.srv.ualberta.ca/) in [January 2015](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/145.full), the first AI to solve *heads-up limit* Texas hold’em, and [DeepStack](https://www.deepstack.ai/) in [March 2017](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/03/01/science.aam6960), the first AI capable of beating pros at *heads-up no-limit* Texas Hold’em. Given Prof. Bowling’s track record, we are convinced of his estimate and assign a **90% confidence interval of ± 3 months** that computers will beat pros in *multi-player no-limit* poker on **March 6, 2019**.

In July 2017, Prof. Bowling joined [DeepMind](http://realai.org/labs/deepmind/) to colead its [newly created research office in Edmonton, Alberta](https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-office-canada-edmonton/). DeepMind is the [Alphabet](http://realai.org/industry/alphabet/) subsidiary that developed [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/), the first computer program to achieve superhuman performance in the ancient Chinese game of [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).
