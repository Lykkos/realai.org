# Progress

The basic idea of using artificial neural networks to build human-level intelligence has been around for a long time. For decades, it was considered a dead end despite its intellectual appeal and soundness because there was little evidence that neural networks could solve practical problems better than other methods. It turned out that the idea was foundamentally correct, it was mainly due to insufficient computing power that the promise of neural networks didn't materialize.

Since 2012, there have been rapid advances in various fronts towards the technology to build general intelligence. A common theme in these advances is that the basic ideas were discovered decades ago, long before it was practical to test them out in large scale. With enough computing power, natural extensions of those ideas demonstrated surprising successes in many cognitive tasks. At the RSA Conference on 23 February 2017, Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt [said in an interview](https://youtu.be/-UViiNq-dxk?t=6m) that both he and Alphabet co-founder Larry Page now believe that simple algorithms can scale to reproduce human abilities.

By June 2017, the training of a ResNet-50 model on ImageNet [took just one hour](https://research.fb.com/publications/ImageNet1kIn1h/), using a minibatch size of 8192 on 256 GPUs.

## Unsupervised Learning

In June 2012, Google [discovered](https://googleblog.blogspot.hk/2012/06/using-large-scale-brain-simulations-for.html) that one artificial neuron of its large-scale neural network learned to respond to pictures of cats ([Le et al., 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209)), despite the fact that no supervisory signals were given during training. Their models had more than 1 billion connections, an order of magnitude larger than other large networks used back then.
